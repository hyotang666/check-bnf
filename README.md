# check-bnf
## What is this?
Macro arguments checker.

### Current lisp world
Common Lisp has true macro.
Writing macro means extending compiler i.e. creating new language.

### Issues
Lack of documentations.
Do you want to use LANGUAGE which has no documentation nor BNF?

### Proposal
Check-bnf provides bnf like syntax checker.

It allows you to write macro arguments definition.

It helps the third person to understand your macro.
